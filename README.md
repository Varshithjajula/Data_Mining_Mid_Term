# Data Mining: Comparative Analysis of Algorithms

## Introduction

This project is a comparative analysis of three well-known data mining algorithms: **Brute Force**, **Apriori**, and **FP-Growth**. These algorithms are commonly used in frequent itemset mining and association rule generation. The goal of this project is to compare their performance and efficiency when applied to transactional datasets.

## Algorithms Overview

- **Brute Force**: A straightforward method for finding frequent itemsets by generating all possible combinations and checking for their frequency.
- **Apriori**: A popular algorithm that uses a bottom-up approach, generating frequent itemsets and pruning based on minimum support thresholds.
- **FP-Growth**: A more efficient algorithm that constructs a prefix tree (FP-tree) to extract frequent itemsets without generating candidate itemsets explicitly.

## Datasets

The datasets represent transactional data for various stores, including:
- **Amazon**
- **Best Buy**
- **K-Mart**
- **Nike**
- **Domino's**

Each dataset contains a list of items typically found in these stores, and the goal is to mine frequent itemsets and generate association rules based on user-defined support and confidence thresholds.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following Python packages:

- `pandas`
- `mlxtend`
- `csv`
- `itertools`
- `time`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas mlxtend
```



## Usage

1. **Generating Transactional Data**: The script generates CSV files for each store, representing the transactional datasets.
   
2. **Running the Algorithms**:
   - Choose the store dataset for analysis.
   - Set the minimum support and confidence thresholds.
   - The script will apply the Brute Force, Apriori, and FP-Growth algorithms to generate frequent itemsets and association rules.

3. **Comparing Results**: The script compares the number of frequent itemsets and association rules generated by each algorithm, as well as the execution time.

### Steps to Run

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python Varshith_jajula_MidTermProj.py
   ```
2. Select a store dataset for analysis from the provided options.
3. Enter the desired minimum support and confidence thresholds (as percentages).

### Example:

```bash
Select a store to analyze:
1. Amazon
2. Best Buy
3. K-Mart
4. Nike
5. Domino's

Enter the minimum support threshold (as a percentage, 0-100): 20
Enter the minimum confidence threshold (as a percentage, 0-100): 50
```

### Expected Output:

After running the code, the script will output the total count of frequent itemsets and association rules for each store. and  the association rules and the execution times for each algorithm will be displayed. This provides insight into the efficiency of each algorithm while focusing on the key results of association rule mining.

### Results:

The performance analysis shows that the FP-Growth algorithm is the most efficient for frequent itemset mining. While the Brute Force algorithm demonstrates relatively fast performance compared to Apriori, FP-Growth significantly outperforms both by constructing an FP-tree, which allows for mining frequent itemsets without the need to generate candidate itemsets. This results in faster execution times, especially on large datasets, making FP-Growth the optimal choice in terms of efficiency and scalability.

### Conclusion:
FP-Growth is recommended for large datasets due to its efficiency, while Apriori provides a reliable, if slower, alternative. The Brute Force method, while easy to understand, is not recommended for larger datasets due to its performance limitations.
